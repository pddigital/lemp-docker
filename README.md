# LEMP Docker Minimal Starter Kit
Linux, NGINX, MYSQL, PHP - with Docker Compose and XDebug

Useful tutorial on getting X-Debug working with this build in PhpStorm:
https://dev.to/_mertsimsek/using-xdebug-with-docker-2k8o

To Start:
``docker-compose up --build``

Not much more to it.

You can access the web at
``localhost:8888`` and MYSQL with your favorite client at
``localhost:3333``.

I didn't go too overboard with what's included here.
